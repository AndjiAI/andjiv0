# andji vs Claude Code

Anthropic recently released Claude Code, their own AI coding assistant.

Both andji and Claude Code:

- Run in your terminal for a seamless coding experience
- Understand your entire codebase context
- Can edit files and execute terminal commands
- Use Claude Sonnet as their primary model

## When to Choose andji

andji might be a better choice if you value:

- Speed: andji is [nearly 4 times faster](https://x.com/jahooma/status/1894224663817195599)
- Cost: andji is one third the cost of Claude Code for equivalent tasks and even less for back-and-forth conversation
- Codebase Analysis: andji pulls more context from scanning your entire codebase, rather than file-by-file. andji also [blends different models](/docs/advanced#what-models-do-you-use?) based on their strengths to provide more accurate results.
- Staying in Flow: andji requires fewer confirmation prompts for file edits and command execution.
- Focused changes: andji does just what you asked for, while Claude Code will often get carried away editing more and more files.
- SDK and Programmatic Access: andji provides a full TypeScript SDK for programmatic integration, allowing you to create custom workflows and embed AI coding capabilities into your own tools.
- Advanced Agent System: Create custom agents with TypeScript generator functions, spawn subagents, and orchestrate complex multi-step workflows that go far beyond simple chat interactions.

## When to Choose Claude Code

Claude Code might be a better choice if you:

- You require first-party Anthropic integration (no intermediary/proxy) for procurement, data handling, or legal reasons
- You need enterprise security/compliance controls directly from Anthropic (e.g., SOC 2/ISO programs, data-retention controls, private/VPC networking options)
- Your org needs centralized admin controls within Anthropic's ecosystem (SSO, RBAC, governance, auditability)
- You prioritize early access to Anthropic model capabilities and first-party tooling
