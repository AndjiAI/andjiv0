Remember that andji understands natural language, so you don't need to use exact commands. Describe what you want to do in your own words, and andji will help you accomplish it.

## Tips for Better Results

1. Be specific about what files or components you're working with
2. Provide context about what you're trying to achieve
3. If the first attempt isn't quite right, clarify what you need
4. Use knowledge.md files to teach andji about project-specific patterns
